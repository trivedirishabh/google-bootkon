## Introduction

{% if MY_NAME %}Hi **{{ MY_NAME }}! 👋** {% endif %}Welcome to Agentic Data Bootkon. We're delighted to have you! This sidebar contains parts of the labs you will work through. Before we get started, let's set up a few things:

### Working with labs

You can insert commands into the terminal using the following button on top of each code line in the tutorial:
<walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon></walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon>. The button will automatically open the terminal.
Please make sure you are using the terminal of the IDE.

Let's try:

```bash
echo "Lets go, Cymbal"
```

Execute by pressing the return key in the terminal that has been opened in the lower part of your screen.

### Check your environment

The setup command you pasted has already configured everything. Let's verify it:

* Your `PROJECT_ID` is `{% if PROJECT_ID == "" %}None{% else %}{{ PROJECT_ID }}{% endif %}`

* Your `GCP_USERNAME` is `{% if GCP_USERNAME == "" %}None{% else %}{{ GCP_USERNAME }}{% endif %}`

If both are correct, you are done — press the `START` button below to get started!
(Tip: if you ever close this tutorial or the editor, type `bk-start` in the
terminal to reopen them.)

If a value is wrong or shows `None`: open `vars.local.sh`
<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="vars.local.sh">by clicking here</walkthrough-editor-open-file>,
fix the value (e.g. point `PROJECT_ID` at your event project), and save.

Then reload the environment and refresh the values shown on this page:

```bash
. bk && bk-start
```

{% include 'agenticdata/labs/1_environment_setup.md' %}

{% include 'agenticdata/labs/2_replication.md' %}

{% include 'agenticdata/labs/3_dataform.md' %}

{% include 'agenticdata/labs/4_governance.md' %}

{% include 'agenticdata/labs/5_data_agent.md' %}

{% include 'agenticdata/labs/6_a2a.md' %}


## The end

You've made it! Congratulations and thank you for participating in this event.
