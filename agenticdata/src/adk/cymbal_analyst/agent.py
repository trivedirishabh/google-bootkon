"""cymbal_analyst -- the analytics specialist agent.

It answers business questions by consulting Cymbal's published BigQuery data
agent (Conversational Analytics) and is exposed to other agents over the A2A
protocol by a2a_server.py.

All configuration (PROJECT_ID, GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI, BK_CYMBAL_MODEL,
BK_DATA_AGENT_ID) comes from environment variables in vars.local.sh (written by
bk / bk-bootstrap in Lab 1). Vertex AI reads GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT, which Cloud
Shell provides (= PROJECT_ID).
