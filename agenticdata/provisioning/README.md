# Agenticdata provisioning (organizer tooling)

Everything **project-bound** — APIs, IAM, service accounts, the network path,
Datastream's private connection and BigQuery connection profile, the jump VM,
the PSC endpoint, the Cloud SQL instance (schema and seed data loaded), the
seed bucket and the bronze dataset — is provisioned here, ahead of the event. Participants never
wait on a build or an IAM propagation race; their Lab 1 starts on a project
where the infrastructure already exists. Participant-side setup (pip, seed
data, agy, per-user secrets) stays in `../bk-bootstrap` and `bk-init`.

## Quick start

Prep the whole fleet from your laptop (one Cloud Build **per participant
project**; nothing runs locally, the terminal returns after submitting):

```bash
./bk-prep-fleet "Bootkon Accounts - Sheet1.csv"
```

Watch progress / check readiness any time (read-only, repeat freely). The
prefix is optional for both commands — without it the projects are looked up by
deriving the fleet prefix automatically:

```bash
./bk-verify-fleet "Bootkon Accounts - Sheet1.csv"
```

Single account (testing) — pass a username instead of the CSV:

```bash
./bk-prep-fleet devstar1234@gcplab.me
./bk-verify-fleet devstar1234@gcplab.me
```

Wake the fleet shortly before the stream starts — the parked Cloud SQL
instances take a few minutes to come up, and doing it centrally means nobody
waits in Lab 1:

```bash
./bk-wake-fleet "Bootkon Accounts - Sheet1.csv"
```

Reset a project completely — everything the stream created, provisioning
*and* whatever the labs built (needs owner):

```bash
./bk-reset-project bootkon-event-1234
```

Or roll back just the provisioning, terraform-style (needs an intact state):

```bash
./bk-prep-project --destroy devstar1234@gcplab.me bootkon-event-1234
```

The CSV needs the username in the first column (header row is skipped);
`project = PREFIX + numeric suffix of the username`. Both `bk-prep-fleet` and
`bk-verify-fleet` take the prefix optionally and otherwise look the projects up
by that number; `bk-prep-project` takes the full project id (project/username in
either order — the `@` disambiguates).

## The pieces

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `bk-prep-fleet` | Fan-out over the CSV (or one username; prefix optional). Default mode submits Cloud Builds (server-side, submit-and-return). Pass `--local` to run preps locally via xargs (`BK_PREP_PARALLEL`, default 8). |
| `bk-prep-project` | The engine — everything below happens in here, identically on your laptop, in Cloud Shell and inside Cloud Build. |
| `bk-wake-fleet` | Starts every Cloud SQL instance in every project (the prep parks them). Run it ~30 min before the stream; waits until all are RUNNABLE (`--no-wait` to fire and return). Idempotent. |
| `bk-verify-fleet` | Read-only readiness check, ~26 checks per project (prefix optional). Green one-liner when ready; yellow with the pending components while a prep is still running; red with an ok/missing split otherwise. Exit code = fleet readiness. |
| `cloudbuild.yaml` | Wraps `bk-prep-project` for Cloud Build. `$PROJECT_ID` is the built-in substitution, so every build preps the project it runs in. |
| `terraform/` | The desired state (APIs, IAM, service accounts, network, private connection, jump VM, SQL, PSC endpoint). |
| `bk-reset-project` | Wipes a project back to pre-bootkon: prep resources *and* lab-created ones (streams, medallion datasets, scans, glossaries, policy tags, data agents, Dataform repos, Analytics Hub, dashboards), plus the state bucket. Needs no terraform state; keeps APIs and IAM. |
| `bk-seed-project` | Generates Cymbal's data, stages it in the bucket and imports schema + tables into Cloud SQL via the Admin API (no network path needed). Per-object markers make it resume-safe. Called by `bk-prep-project`. |
| `ensure-terraform` | Sourced helper: single Terraform version pin, self-installs into `~/.local/bin` when missing (Cloud Shell does not preinstall Terraform). |
| `bk-init` | NOT organizer-run: the stream hook `. bk` executes at participant setup (secrets, runtime config, background wake of the parked SQL instance). |

## How it works

- **State per project, no central anything.** Each project gets
  `gs://<project>-tfstate` inside itself; the state dies with the sandbox.
  There is no organizer project.
- **Identity.** Pass 1 of `bk-prep-fleet` creates a `bootkon-provisioner`
  service account with `roles/owner` in each project; the builds run as that
  SA. The caller additionally gets project-level `serviceAccountUser`
  (required to submit builds as a custom SA). Two passes on purpose: the
  grants age while the rest of the loop runs.
- **Cloud SQL is parked.** The instance is built running (the API refuses to
  create it stopped), then parked (`activation_policy NEVER`, storage-only
  cost ~$0.06/day). The participant's `. bk` wakes it in the background;
  Lab 1 carries a visible backup start. Prep days ahead is therefore cheap —
  the only meaningful cost starts when the instances are woken
  (~$1.70/day each), by the participants or centrally via `bk-wake-fleet`.
- **Self-healing, rerun-safe.** Re-running preps only what is missing.
  On top of the idempotent applies: pre-existing same-named resources (e.g.
  from older manual runs) are **adopted** into the state via `terraform
  import` and converged; a `FAILED` Datastream private connection (the IAM
  propagation race that survives even the built-in 180s buffer) is deleted
  and re-applied once; **stale** state locks (dead runs, killed builds) are
  broken automatically after 60 minutes — while a lock younger than that
  means a prep is genuinely running, and the second run backs off instead of
  interfering (`bk-prep-fleet` also skips projects with an active build).
- **Version pins.** Terraform in `ensure-terraform` (one pin for all
  runners — mixed versions would make the state unreadable to older CLIs),
  providers in `terraform/versions.tf`.

## Timing and requirements

- A prep takes **15–25 minutes per project** (SQL build and private
  connection run inside the apply, in parallel); with one build per project
  the whole fleet finishes in roughly the same wall time.
- The **caller** needs rights on every participant project. The gcplab base
  provisioning (editor + projectIamAdmin, see the other streams'
  `bk-bootstrap-accounts`) is sufficient — pass 1 self-grants the rest.
- On **Argolis/self-run** there is no organizer: Lab 1 has the participant
  run `bk-prep-project` themselves (Terraform self-installs; org policies
  may need loosening, the lab says which).

## When something is red

`bk-verify-fleet` names the missing component per project. The fix is almost
always the same: run `bk-prep-fleet` again for the affected
accounts (safe to repeat), then verify again. Raw build logs:
`gcloud builds list --project=<project>` /
`gcloud builds log <id> --project=<project>`.
